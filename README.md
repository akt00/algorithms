# Description
  Full scratch implementations of basic algorithms and data structures in C++.

# Requirements
  Requires the version of C++17 or later. This library is simply built with C++ standard libraries without external dependencies. Thus, including "algorithm.h" header file is all you need to do. (no need to be built).
